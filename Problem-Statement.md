# 🏏 Problem Statement: Cricket Data Analytics

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to analyze player performance data across multiple cricket categories (e.g., Openers, Finishers, Anchors, Fast Bowlers, All-Rounders) and build a **data-driven Power BI dashboard** that:

- Evaluates individual player contributions using stats like strike rate, economy, average, etc.
- Assists in **automated team selection** by filtering the best-performing players by role.
- Provides interactive visualizations to explore performance insights by category and match role.
- Supports strategy planning by identifying player suitability for various match situations.

## 📊 Categories Analyzed

The dashboard evaluates the following cricket roles:
